## Installation

To begin, we need to make sure we have our database seeded into MySQL in our terminal!

`mysql -u root -p`

Then, enter your password.

`source db/schema.sql`

Now that your database has been inputted, let's install our dependencies, Sequelize, and dotenv.

`npm install`

This will install the Sequelize and dotenv modules.

Next, we must seed our database with sample seeds so that we can see them correctly when we apply the enpoint routes inside Insomnia. 

`npm run seed`

Finally, let's invoke our application,

`node server.js`


Now we can open Insomnia while our program is running to test our back-end route API endpoints!
